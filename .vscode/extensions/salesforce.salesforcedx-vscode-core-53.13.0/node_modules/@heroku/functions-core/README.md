# @salesforce/functions-core

Library for interacting with Salesforce Functions.

This library is very much a work-in-progress, but will evolve over time to cover the full range
of functonality available when working with Salesforce Functions.

Currently, this library exposes only two functions: `generateProject` and `generateFunction`, as well as a custom error class (`FunctionsError`).
