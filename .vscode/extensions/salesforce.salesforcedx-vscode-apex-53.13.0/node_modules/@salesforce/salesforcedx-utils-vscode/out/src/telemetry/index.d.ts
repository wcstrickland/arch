 * If your service or util is dependent on telemetry service, please leave the index
 * of your service folder empty as well, and export your service in src/index.ts.
 * Otherwise, you will have a duplicate copy of telemetry service in your folder,
 * for webpack treats the index of each folder as an entry point
 * and bundles all of its dependencies.
